I have written an article on the fundamental principles of creating a network. The content includes "What is a Network and its Place in Our Lives?" where I discussed the reasons for establishing computer networks and their application areas. I gained information about the classification of computer networks based on geographical location, including Local Area Network (LAN), WLAN, WAN, and other networks, and incorporated this into my article. I delved into network architecture and categories. Based on my research, I shared my ideas on addressing computer network security issues and vulnerabilities in the article.
